									<p>Using the Myers-Briggs test results, it is apparent that a group's dynamic will be the blueprint to manage the accumulation of a project. For an assignment like this, roles must be divided equitably. Given most of us are diplomats, we have been independent in our research and study, checking in on each other intermittently. Such a method seems to be a healthy way to move forward, as we all have a common cause, and falling behind is not an option.</p>

									<p>Our learning styles have given us insight into how we should be presenting our information to the team. Using tools such as word, GitHub, and PowerPoint, and keeping each other updated on MS teams ensures everyone can maintain pace and absorb information. Weekly online meetings give us a chance to explain our strategies, give insight and feedback into the assignment, and clear up anything a group member may need to understand.  </p>

   									<p>We have a broad range of career paths each member would like to undertake, some of these roles are more on the business administration and marketing side (CTO & BDM). Others are more back end focused, in the realm of research and development. And one requires skills from both sides of the spectrum and acts like the corpus collosum of the two hemispheres. These roles require us to build on group projects or define challenges based on investor requirements and client demands.  </p>
   									<p>
   									Our collective skill set puts us in a position to accomplish many projects in an array of industries. An excellent example of this is the Starlink project by SpaceX, currently underway and on track give developing nations highspeed affordable internet access, connecting them with the rest of the planet and adding an extra 3 - 4 billion potential e-commerce customers. A project like this requires hours of development, constant cybersecurity testing, satellite and receiver maintenance, and a robust business model, as the goal is to maintain a healthy income for SpaceX's main projects.
