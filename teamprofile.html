									<h1>Test Results</h1>
									<p>Using the Myers-Briggs test results, it is apparent that a group's dynamic will be the blueprint to manage the accumulation of a project. For an assignment like this, roles must be divided equitably. Given most of us are diplomats, we have been independent in our research and study, checking in on each other intermittently. Such a method seems to be a healthy way to move forward, as we all have a common cause, and falling behind is not an option.</p>

									<p>Our learning styles have given us insight into how we should be presenting our information to the team. Using tools such as word, GitHub, and PowerPoint, and keeping each other updated on MS teams ensures everyone can maintain pace and absorb information. Weekly online meetings give us a chance to explain our strategies, give insight and feedback into the assignment, and clear up anything a group member may need to understand.  </p>
