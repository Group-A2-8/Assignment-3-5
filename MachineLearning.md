1. What is the state of the art of this new technology? (207 words)

*Wiki says ... State-of-the-art (sometimes cutting edge or leading edge) refers to the highest level of general development, as of a device, technique, or scientific field achieved at a particular time. However, in some contexts it can also refer to a level of development reached at any particular time as a result of the common methodologies employed at the time.*

One of the fastest growing developments occurring in IT at the moment is Machine Learning.  Over the course of a day, we interact with apps and websites that utilise the power of Machine Learning.  From photo sharing, messaging, online shopping, voice recognition, health care, and even customer service, the integration of machine learning to our daily routines is slowly becoming seamless.  

Taking a dive into computing as a whole, we can see where machine learning fits in.   Diagram 1<sup>1</sup> shows that Machine Learning is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is a part of Computer Science.  Diagram 2<sup>2</sup> shows three different learning models and which systems they are integrated in to.  Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labelled examples where the system knows the answer.  Unsupervised learning is used when the system does not know the answer and must explore the data to find patterns.  Reinforcement learning is often used in gaming and robotics.  The system learns what the best action is to return the greatest rewards through trial and error.  We could then define Machine Learning as a system of automated data processing algorithms (sequences of instructions performed to solve a problem) that help to make decision making more natural and enhance performance based on the results<sup>3</sup>.

2. What can be done now? (276 words)

Machine Learning touches our lives in many areas but as we can see in diagram 2, different algorithms are used in different sectors based on the way the data is collected and the desired outcome to your query.

Let's take a look at Supervised Learning, which is used in spam email detection, image classification, weather forecasting, and identity fraud detection.  A supervised learning approach to spam emails uses the frequency or importance of words in the training data to explore and analyse if the email should be classified as spam or non-spam (ham). That's how services like GMail develop their spam filter.  The banking and finance sector uses supervised learning to identify clients with high-risk profiles and pinpoint warning signs of fraud<sup>4</sup>.  The image classification algorithms of supervised learning help Pinterest, who purchased a machine learning company in 2015, learn what its users want next<sup>5</sup>.

Unsupervised learning can be used for facial and image recognition, feature elicitation, targeted marketing, and for big data visualisation.  A facial recognition services can compare the facial properties of individuals and cross-checks it on a vast amount of other data sets. This is how Facebook can not only correctly recognise your face, but also suggest your lookalike or doppelganger celebrity<sup>6</sup>.  For those of us who like taking photos but want that pro-look, app company Pixelmator use feature elicitation to deliver more intelligent image editing by using a model that has been trained on over 20 million professional photos<sup>7</sup>. Streaming service Netflix uses targeted marketing with such ever increasing accuracy that 75% of its users select films recommended to them by the company’s machine learning algorithms<sup>8</sup>. Even government agencies such as public safety and utilities have a particular need for machine learning. By mining their large amounts of data, big data visualisation can identify ways to increase energy efficiency and save money.

Reinforcement learning can be used in video game AI, real-time decision making and robot navigation.  Microsoft's Project Mamlo created an AI-based development platform in Minecraft with the goal to study complex virtual environments and apply the lessons learned from that study to the physical world.  The real-time decision making and robot navigation data from the popular Grand Theft Auto V, is helping to train autonomous vehicles, robots, and drones.  The gaming software makes it possible to cycle through millions of possibilities and find subtle anomalies and correlations that determine whether an autonomous vehicle manoeuvres correctly for a dog on the road and stops at a traffic light that is not working, or simply crashes, at a relatively low cost to researchers <sup>9</sup>.






of the project was to experiment with and study complex virtual environments and apply the lessons learned from that study to the physical world. Katja Hofmann, chief researcher for the project, has stated that “endless possibilities for experimentation” exist. Others, such as Google’s Deep-Mind project, are also examining games and how they can apply data to the physical world.
Not surprisingly, there are limitations to how video games can be used to train robotic and autonomous systems. Software such as Grand Theft Auto V typically requires hundreds of millions of dollars to develop, yet these packages are available commercially at a relatively low cost. Essentially, the game manufacturer is footing the bill for research and development that would be unachievable and unaffordable in a lab. As a result, the use of games for machine learning will likely be limited to specific fields, such as autonomous vehicle and robotics research. It’s difficult to envision a game for training surgical robots, for example. Nevertheless, the idea of using AI to extract data from games and apply it to the real world is gaining momentum. Not only do these simulations eliminate the cost, time, and human resources involved with building and operating complex machines—autonomous vehicles, robots, drones, software agents and more—they make it possible to cycle through millions of possibilities and find subtle anomalies and correlations that determine whether an autonomous vehicle manoeuvres correctly for a dog on the road and stops at a traffic light that is not working, or simply crashes.

Healthcare - thanks to the advent of wearable devices and sensors that can use data to assess a patient's health in real time. Image processing to classify anomalies in human organs for early detection of cancers

Retail and e-commerce - Websites recommending items you might like based on previous purchases are using machine learning to analyse your buying history.  Retailers rely on machine learning to capture data, analyse it and use it to personalize a shopping experience, implement a marketing campaign, price optimization, merchandise supply planning, and for customer insights.   

Energy sectors

Transportation - Self-driving cars from Google  
Analysing data to identify patterns and trends is key to the transportation industry, which relies on making routes more efficient and predicting potential problems to increase profitability. The data analysis and modelling aspects of machine learning are important tools to delivery companies, public transportation and other transportation organizations.


The goal of machine learning is to perfect the predictive function by refining it on as much data as possible. That explains why large databases such as Facebook's, in which the algorithm continuously compares facial properties of individuals and cross-checks it on a vast amount of other data sets, cannot only correctly recognise your face but also suggest your lookalike or doppelganger celebrity.

Other important applications of machine learning are spam mail filters, iris recognition for security systems, the evaluation of consumer behaviour, assessing risks in the financial sector or developing strategies for computer
games.  A prominent example is a spam mail filter that learns from user behaviour and external databases to classify new spam mails correctly.  Use a quantum decision tree to more accurately classify an email as ‘spam’, ‘no spam’ or ‘unsure’.

Why is machine learning important?
Resurging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors that have made data mining and Bayesian analysis more popular than ever. Things like growing volumes and varieties of available data, computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful, and affordable data storage.
All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyse bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And by building precise models, an organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown risks. 4 Hui Li.
