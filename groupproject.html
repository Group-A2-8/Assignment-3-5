									<h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
									<p>Our project is an automated solar hydroponic garden with integrated smart home capabilities and LiFi utilisation. Its aimed to be marketed at the public to bring each home into an eco-friendly and secure technological future. It will be fully self-sufficient and only require the owner to harvest the produce and add the fertiliser when the tank becomes empty. The system will monitor when to empty the water going through, it will also monitor and control fertiliser concentrations in the solution via spectrometry, the system will monitor and charge a battery cell connected to the device so that it runs over night. It will have LED grow lights to maximise yield with the least amount of work. In addition to the LED lights being used in the growing process they will also enable to utilisation of LiFi technology to create a secure connection to the system. If the “smart home” feature is enabled, the user will be able to operate all features using their centralised smart home device or remotely. It will aim to reduce the environmental damage of the agricultural industry, reduce the living cost per household, promote healthy eating with fresh food available directly at home. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
									<p>Currently, we live in an unsustainable world where almost every action we take, every little thing we buy creates a larger carbon footprint than the earth can recycle. The agricultural industry is one of the biggest contributors to our current climate crisis. This not only includes the expulsion of methane, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide, it also includes mass deforestation causing population decline of many native Australian flora and fauna. It's also poisoning our vital waterways by the runoff of fertiliser, creating algal blooms of cyanobacteria which deplete the water of oxygen and collapse entire ecosystems in the waterways. In addition to our current climate crisis we are increasingly being challenged with providing proper methods of security in relation to IoT devices. The use of Lifi will aim to overcome some of the many challenges faced with security in the information age. The motivation of the project is to provide more secure IoT devices and reduce these devasting effects by putting the power in the hands of citizens and creating less of a demand, therefore reduce the industry and its impact on the planet.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<b>The Garden System</b><br>
									<p>The hydroponic system will be free standing and have one PVC pipe zigzag from top to bottom, this will be the plant ladder. A water pump will push the solution of water and soluble fertiliser through a clear plastic tube to the top of the PVC piping from a storage tank. Gravity will then pull the solution down the pipe and running gently over the root system of your plants back into the storage tank. The storage tank will be constantly monitoring the solution concentration and adjusting it for optimal yields. The system requires that is positioned in an area that receives adequate sunlight.</p>
									<p>The whole system will be encased in a clear plastic container, then a sensor will monitor air temperature and moisture and adjust it accordingly by opening and closing vents in the case. When the system is receiving limited sunlight (a sensor is responsible for detection), the LED grow lights will activate and a light shutter will encase the whole system, this will allow for maximum absorption by the plants and reduce wasted energy.</p>
									<p>After the optimal light exposure has been reached the LEDs will turn off and the shutters will retract. All the electrical components will be connected to a battery cell and an external solar panel. The solar panel will charge the batteries and run the pump during the day and when the voltage of the panel drops too low it will switch to using the battery cell. When the plants are ready to be harvested, the owner will be notified via the mobile app as to which plant exactly is ready, each plant will have a slot allocation.</p>
									<p>To set up the system, the user will use the app to select the appropriate plants for the time of year and which plants grow best in the same conditions to optimise yields and limit (if any) wastes. The user will then place the plant into the allocated slot indicated by the app (and by a flashing Indicator LED) and close the system. The tank system will compromise of the main storage tank where the water and fertiliser solution is contained and connected to the main tank will be a tank containing the fertiliser for the system to use when adjusting the concentrations.</p>
									<p>In addition to the fertiliser tank being connected to the main tank, the main tank will be connected to a fresh water supply. When the tank needs to be cleaned, the app will notify the user and the user will initiate the cleaning program via the app. The pump will stop, the user will switch the pumps output from into the system to the drainage hose. The user will then connect the drainage hose to the pump and to wherever the user would like to dispose of the waste (preferably to an outside garden). Once ready, the user will click on a button in the app and it will run until its finished.</p>

									<b>The Solar Energy Component</b><br>
									<p> The solar energy component of the hydroponic system will compromise of a 350watt solar panel connected to 5 deep cycle lead acid batteries arranged in parallel. Between the batteries and the solar panel will be a charge controller to filter the current and voltage to prevent the overcharging the batteries. Further along on the circuit we will have a DC breaker panel so that any device that utilises DC electricity can be connected here.  </p>
									<p>After the DC breaker panel will be the inverter so that it converts DC to AC and can be used to power those devices requiring AC. It will then connect to the AC breaker panel and after that go straight to the devices that required it. In case of a fault with the batteries or the solar panel there will be a switch that allows the user to connect directly to the electricity of the house. </p>

									<b>The Application</b><br>
									<p>The smartphone app will be able to take complete care of the system, including ordering all of the essential items from the centralised marketplace accessed from the server.  The user will be able to order soil, organic fertilisers, seeds, seedlings, pump and filter replacement parts, and any other parts for the hydroponic system.  Detailed instructions will be on offer for the user to educate themselves on how long a plant will take to be ready for harvest, possible yield capacity of their chosen plant, crop rotation, and companion planting.  This data will be presented to the user in easy to understand charts that can act as historical references when a seasonal planting plan or staggered growing plan is undertaken.  Notifications given from the app, as mentioned above, will alert the user to clean the tank, change a hose in the system, or order new seedlings.</p>

									<b>The Server</b><br>
									<p>The goal of this service will be to organise and share data as a community while maintaining the integrity of user security. For example, a user would like to share their crop progress, results, and ideas while remaining anonymous. As with all public accounts, this information can be shared at the discretion of the user. A sturdy infrastructure is needed in order to store or process any of the intel our sensors and applications will be receiving and sharing. With the substantial shift towards cloud computing, it is necessary to highlight the aspects needed to maintain a private server that will handle multiple users. While cloud services are available widely through Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, it is essential to know how a private network is built around this service.</p>
									<p>Initially, users will access software and join the community using a domain, hence the need for a domain network service. Depending on the number of users, the possibility of requiring more than one virtual machine will rise, therefore requiring a load balancer<sup>[1]</sup>, eliminating the use of several IP addresses. In the case of community growth, rather than scaling a relational database, a non-SQL database may replace this. In order to be accessed frequently, a database cache will be required.</p>
									<p>The bulk of data stored will be regarding plant growth cycles, different plants accessed in different areas, and user progress. This will be required to build upon algorithms in order to provide suggestions to users based on their situation. Once information is entered, clickstream analysis will be used to allow for processing the information taken, whether by input or automated sensors. An excellent open-source method of computing this data is Apache Hadoop software, which may store everything in a data warehouse. A benefit of Hadoop is its diversity when it comes to processing data; it will also allow for the relational and non-SQL database to be processed.  Furthermore, if the need for revenue generation arises, in order to maintain the server, this data may be sold under authorisation<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
									<p>For the user interface, a content delivery network cache allows users to access the application according to the platform being used, whether it is on mobile or desktop. When it comes to user information and management, many Representational State Transfer APIs and user management services are available in order to compartmentalise user data and public data. As for data security; multiple layers are needed to protect sensitive data effectively, including encryption, digital certificates, application firewalls, and constant scanning for vulnerabilities. An entire security package can be dedicated to this.</p>
									<p>Finally, in order to provide this infrastructure, a continuous integration pipeline<sup>[3]</sup> is required. To keep this running and up to scratch, DevOps and quality assurance teams are essential, and the need for these skills will be required upon deployment.</p>
									<p>Upon first inspection, a cloud system may seem convoluted; however as mentioned earlier, IaaS is readily available through a host of providers. For the sake of cost effectiveness, this can be built upon using the afore mentioned components. Each option may present its own benefits, as well as drawbacks. This will be dependent on the scale of this server. </p>

									<b>The “Smart Home” feature</b><br> 

									<p>The heart of Smart Home will be an SBC, sensors and an app that can control the whole home and the systems included. The SBC will be connected with sensors and controllers which will give control over most of the household items thus making the home a smart home.</p>

									<p>There will be light sensors that monitors the light available in the room and switches the lights ON and OFF if required. Even the colour of lights can be changed from the app. With the help of Bluetooth it can watch for the presence of specific Bluetooth-enabled devices (your smartphone, and those of your children, for instance) and take action when that device arrives or leaves—lock or unlock doors, turn on lights, adjust your thermostat, turn off security modes, and so on.</p> 

									<p>With the use of a photoelectric sensor, and when you come home at night, it'll turn lights on for you, but not bother during the daytime. With the help of network-based relays the power sockets and other appliances can be controlled. SBC can also help to setup a media server in the home so each room can have different contents played at the same time.</p>

									<p>In order to have voice control it can be integrated with Amazon Alexa or other similar product. So, saying "Alexa, turn on movie mode." The lights dim, roller blinds close, the home theatre screen rolls down, the Roku, sound system, and projector all turn on, and your Roku starts its Plex client. Additional security features can be added to your home by connecting cameras and having surveillance. This will be connected to the SBC.</p>

									<b>Lifi</b><br> 

									<p>The LiFi dongle will allow Internet access to the single board computer (SBC) used to control the hydroponic system.  The dongle will include our own application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) module to allow for LiFi connectivity and added security through geofencing when connected to the smart home system.  Geofencing is a surveillance technique used to trigger a software response when a particular device enters or leaves a predefined virtual geographical zone.  Our virtual geographical zone will be defined using only the physical dimensions of the hydroponic system.  We will also include scheduled activation times of the types of events being managed, allowing for greater security control.  If the system is attempting to do something that has not been predefined, an intelligent alert will be triggered, and counter measures taken to ensure the system is not being compromised.  These types of checks are done systematically and automatically according to our predefined parameters <sup>[4]</sup>.  The coding for our geofencing can be written in a range of programming languages, allowing us greater flexibility for the hydroponic system.</p>

 

									<p>Initial prototype design of the LiFi dongle would start with a field programmable gate array (FPGA) module as they are considerably cheaper than ASICs but use the same hardware description programming language.   Being field programmable, we would design our FPGA module to include the specific LiFi features of the hydroponic system and fundamentally the control of the LED system.  We would even be able to include radio functionality so the plants can listen to yield increasing music, and voice recognition so the user can activate some of the hydroponic systems features without having to use the app. As FPGA’s are reprogrammable, they are preferred for prototyping and validating a design or concept by many of the major ASIC manufacturers<sup>[5]</sup>.  This has the added benefit of not delaying the final production of the ASIC as the ASIC design can be based on the completed prototype version of the FPGA.  Using the LiFi dongle with the hydroponic system can help make the complete system more energy efficient and in line with our overall carbon neutral footprint</p>

									<h3 class="major">Skills Required</h3>
									<p>In addition to all the parts listed above, the hydroponic system will require multiple different programs to be written for the front end and the back end. These include software to run all the sensors and then calculate the required adjustments for the system, then a program that takes this information and makes the adjustments in the system, like switching to the battery supply when the luxmeter reading is too low or when the sun has set, activate the blinds and the LED lights turn on. We will also require an operating system on the central control module (Raspberry Pi), a compatible mobile application and a program to communicate with the server containing the database required for the whole hydroponic system, cloud storage of the data for the system and application, and hardware description language (HDL) programming of the FPGA and ASIC.</p>
									<p>As the design of the system isn’t too complex and designed to be simple and straight forward the programs will follow suit. This should make the project more feasible and likely to decrease the initial upfront cost and should increase adoption.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Outcome</h3>
									<p>It will hopefully provide households with fresh vegetables in a clean and efficient manner. It will be carbon neutral as it will run completely off solar energy. It will be fully automated and the only required input by the user is simple and cheap in hopes to increase adoption. In the future, the plan is to put the idea forward to the government and negotiate a subsidy scheme mirroring the solar energy scheme. In addition to addressing key environmental impacts it will also encourage healthier eating in every household that adopts this technology, addressing our obesity issue in Australia and in a trickle down kind of effect, reduce the strain on the healthcare system by lifestyle related diseases like diabetes and obesity, and free up funds and resources for other issues we face in Australia with an aging population.</p>
