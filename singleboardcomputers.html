									<p>Single board computers (SBCs) are a complete computer built on a single circuit board, with a microprocessor(s), memory, input/output (I/O) and other features required of a functional computer. These are small computing devices that can be used for a variety of purposes that include experimentation, learning how to program, building a media player or NAS drive, robotics, home automation and performing computing tasks such as web browsing or word processing. SBCs are also increasingly used for a wide range of industrial applications in areas that include robotics and the Internet of things (IoT)</p> 

									<p>Unlike a desktop personal computer, single board computers often do not rely on expansion slots for peripheral functions or expansion. Single board computers have been built using a wide range of microprocessors. Simple designs, such as those built by computer hobbyists, often use static RAM and low-cost 8 or 16-bit processors. Other types, such as blade servers, would perform similar to a server computer, only in a more compact format.</p>

									<p>A few of the SBCs available are Raspberry Pi 4B, LattePanda, Tinker Board, and Arduino Mega 2560.</p>

									<p>The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B from the Raspberry Pi Foundation is the latest incarnation of the world's most popular and most highly supported SBC. It comes with 1, 2 or 4GB of RAM, dual 4K micro HDMI ports, gigabit Ethernet and two USB 3.0 ports.</p>

									<p>The LattePanda from DFRobot is an Atom-based x86 SBC that runs a full, standard version of Windows 10 (32 or 64 bit editions)</p>

									<p>The Tinker Board from Asus is a more expensive and more powerful SBC than a Raspberry Pi 3, if based on the same form-factor.</p>

 
									<p>People buy SBCs to learn coding and to code electronics for physical projects. The SBCs can open opportunities to create our own home automation projects, which are popular among people in the open source community because it puts us in control, rather than the traditional proprietary closed system.</p>  

									<p>It can block ads in your network and make your own twitter bot. With the help of general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins, it allows you to connect electronic components and program physical devices in the real world, such as sensors, lights, the air conditioning, and even control power of your entire house.</p>  

									<p>Other than the serious buyers, there are hobbyist who use SBCs for some amazing projects. One of the highlights of SBCs is its weight. Raspberry Pi Model B weighs 45 grams, and the Model A+ weighs 23 grams. This comes as very handy for sending a data logger, GPS tracker, and camera up into the sky on a helium balloon! That's what Dave Akerman, amateur high-altitude balloonist has done. Dave's managed to get some incredible photographs looking down at Earth from near space. In some, if clear enough, you can make out entire distinguishable masses of land. In others you can see the curvature of the Earth.</p> 


									<p><img src="images/earth.jpg" alt="" /></p>
 

 									<p>Growing adoption of advanced semiconductors in the medical sector is projected to create several growth opportunities for the SBC Market over the coming years. Medical devices are increasingly being integrated with these systems to perform and monitor a range of processes. Features such as power, reliability, and versatility of these systems make them suitable for customized medical monitoring systems, medical electronic devices, and fault tolerant wearable computers, among others.</p> 

									<p>Companies are investing heavily in the development of new technologies, such as industrial robotics, machine automation, and IoT, to improve industrial and manufacturing performance. The processors in the SBC market are based on a unique architecture including ARM, Intel x86 and other custom architectures providing extremely high performance of upwards of 1.2 GHz clock frequency.</p> 

									<p>The flourishing demand across the consumer electronics industry is the major trend in the SBC market. The rising disposable income of consumers is creating a demand for intelligent and smart devices such as gaming consoles, smartphones, tablets, and other wearable devices. In addition, declining prices of these systems have resulted in a greater demand for these systems across the industry, fuelling the SBC market.</p>

									<p>The Arduino SBC market has applications in water treatment systems. It is designed to improve the water quality with the help of a monitoring technology. The programs for these systems are written in Java. Sensors are connected to the Arduino board that processes the information and sends the output through external data transfer methods. These monitoring systems use the GPRS module for wireless data transfer.</p>

									<p><img src="images/gmi.jpg" alt="" /></p>
 

									<p>The information processed by the Arduino board is sent to the webpage through a GPRS module. This GPRS module updates the processed information on the webpage through the Internet. The Arduino platform (ATMega-328) is implemented as a sensor node controller to acquire and process the sensor data. It is an affordable, open source platform that provides I/O pins for customizable applications and is augmenting the SBC market.</p> 

									<p>The SBC market is fuelled by the adoption across the aerospace & defence sector and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13%. The military sector is utilizing Raspberry Pi SBC in surveillance robots. Increasing automation is augmenting the demand in the SBC market. The surveillance robots are IoT-based systems that help the military & defence sector to secure the camp or border area using a manually controlled or autonomous vehicle with an Internet connection.</p> 

									<p>Companies contributing toward the growth of the SBC market include Adlink Technology, Mercury Systems, American Portwell, Radisys Advantech, and MERCURY Systems.</p>

									<p>As SBCs are considered the heart or core of a system, the advancement of other technologies will have much effect on this. Especially technologies like AI, IoT, and Machine Learning that are being helped by the rapid growth of SBCs.</p> 

									<p>The growth of 3D printing and nano technology will also impact the SBCs. At the moment the common concerns SBC’s are not used in industrial environments due to its robustness and safety. As nano technology and 3D printing improves, ruggedized versions can be made which is required to meet industrial standards. Now that edge computing is becoming more popular, SBCs will benefit from it.</p>  

									<p>We could see that AI is being driven away from data centres and SBCs are being made AI-friendly. Edge computing shifts the AI execution from a data centre to a device. While machine learning is not often executed locally (as this is a complex and expensive task), the neural networks produced as a result of the machine-learning process can be executed locally. Tasks that require only the use of neural nets include handwriting, gesture recognition, and object recognition. However, while edge computing sounds great, it has one major disadvantage: AI neural nets can be incredibly complex and difficult to run! While microcontrollers such as the Arduino can be made to run neural nets, the speed at which they would run practical nets would be incredibly slow — so much so, in fact, that the use of a cloud-based AI system would seem almost instantaneous better by comparison.</p>

 

									<p>There are many ways in which SBCs have a positive impact on the world. It’s used in military applications, AI, classrooms, libraries, hackspaces, research laboratories, and within the industrial environment. People of all ages use SBCs, in these contexts and others, to learn about computing and to create things with computers that we never could have imagined. The potential impact of this development will be in military, AI, and the automation world with SBCs as the core. Single board computers are experiencing a renaissance in all sorts of military computing applications. Much of this can be attributed to the increasing number of different SBC form factors available to the military computer system designer: PICMG 1.3, PC/104, COM Express, MicroTCA, and 3U VPX boards, to name only a few. These SBCs offer inherent system architecture flexibility, while lending themselves well to advances in compute density and processor power and capabilities. We can see SBCs platforms deployed on a military vehicle and airborne surveillance platform. Another area is considering SBCs as a replacement of your desktop. Because of more accessible technology like the Raspberry Pi and freely available online resources, it’s easier than ever to make the things that you want to see in the world.</p>  

 
									<p>Things that are likely to change due to the advancement of SBC’s will be the existing closed platforms that have proprietary rights of systems. As long as this technology expands, more open source systems will be available and thus reduce the costs. We could also see the military with AI robots with the help of SBC’s. AI products running on SBC’s and even for surveillance.</p>  


									<p>This will affect the whole world, mainly North America and Asia Pacific Region because in these areas, studies have shown that the current market of SBCs is $620 million and is expected to reach $1 billion by 2025. In the future, we could see robots being deployed as troops which would drastically reduce the human fatalities in a war zone but on the other hand rapidly increase unemployment within the military sector. Industrial automation will impact people working in industries as well.</p> 

 

									<p>Yes, this will have a severe impact on the job market. Manufacturers will be forced to have an open platform product and that can lead to the loss of their majority in the industries. People who have certifications in product related or technology related programs will be forced to switch to open source platforms which anyone can easily achieve and thus becomes a competitive world. Being a solider will not be a job anymore and print media will be affected by AI. So the reduced number of jobs will be another prediction.</p> 

 

									<p>There will be an impact from this on my daily life. It can be both positive and negative. I believe things will be more mechanical due to automation. But the good thing about having an automated house is that before you reach your house the lights will be on if required, temperature will be ideal, and the TV will be on with your favourite channels playing. The moment you step in, the doors open automatically. Water will be hot and thus makes you ready for a bath. Maybe the foods will be ready if you have a robotic kitchen. AI devices could read books for me or can even play songs to make children fall sleep with limited Internet access and even more privacy settings. Hospitals will have AI robots replacing nurses.</p> 

 

									<p>I will be more productive and have more time to spend with family. I can get desktops and laptops for lower cost. Things will be more proactive and even you will have reduced electricity bills. I don’t need to turn off and on lights or the AC. If robotic kitchens are available it will take care of the dishes as well. While using the Internet, Ads will be blocked. I can even have a web server for my family. I can turn my Pi into a set-top box capable of streaming my favourite content. For relatively little money, I can build my own inexpensive wireless security camera. All I need is the relatively cheap Raspberry Pi Zero W and one of the two official Raspberry Pi cameras. Pi can help keep my plants stay alive. With a soil moisture sensor, a pump and the right software, the Pi can detect when the plant needs water and deliver the necessary liquid. Personal health will be monitored with the help of technologies that run on SBC’s.</p>   

 

									<p>Everyone can have an automated house for a cheaper price. All will be able to have a beautiful garden where the watering will be automatic. Washrooms will be diagnosing stations which provide your daily health reports. I don’t need to worry about my family members who will be working in the military.</p>
