									<h3 class="major">Job Titles</h3>
									<p><b>Jake</b>’s ideal job is as a Penetration Tester and the demand for this role in the IT labour market is 2nd in comparison to the rest of the team members. This role centres on cybersecurity and network vulnerability in aims to identify current vulnerabilities, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and how they can be rectified to a client’s current security flaws.</p>

									<p><b>Stephen</b>’s ideal job is a Java Developer and the demand for this role in the IT labour market is the highest in comparison to the rest of his team members. The role of a Java Developer is to be involved throughout the whole development life cycle of a product.  They must also be able to identify and analyse any issues or problems and be able to come up with efficient and effective solutions.</p>

									<p><b>Alan</b>’s is a Java Developer. Out of the roles in our group, Java developers rank the highest demand. Java developers build on core java programming, using mainly Oracle-based software to work with other systems and applications.</p>

									<p><b>Akhil</b>’s ideal job is a CTO (Chief Technology Officer), even though this does not have a huge no of opening. This role requires Technical and Management skills. It includes leadership quality and knowledge and deep understanding of IT technologies. </p>

									<p><b>Jack</b>’s ideal job is a Business Development Manager. The role is a combination of both business and technology and requires a strong understanding of both fields. Anyone in this role should be able to translate both business and IT concepts to those who specialise in the fields. A successful employee in this role will enhance the businesses' efficiency through the use of technology. </p>

									<h3 class="major">How they rank</h3>
									<ol><li><b>Stephen & Alan</b></li><br>
										<p>Java developers are ranked the highest according to Burning Glass data. These positions include two of the three highest demand IT-specific skills, JavaScript and Java programming languages. As well as these in-demand skills, industry specific skills will be needed to advance one’s career. The corporate sector has the highest demand, as well as job retention for Java developers, as this specialisation requires a wide software experience base. </p>
										<p>As for soft skills; communication, interpersonal skills, teamwork, and a willingness to learn are coveted by most industries. A developer is always required to translate client needs into an objected oriented architecture and must relay outcomes without conjecture. Due to the nature of IT, developers are expected to maintain Java and SQL standards and remain apprised of up and coming software advancements.</p>

									<li><b>Jake</b></li><br>
									<p>Jake ranks second, according to the data provided by Burning Glass. This position requires a strong knowledge of SQL, scripting languages like JavaScript and Python as well as strong command of operating systems like Windows and Linux. SQL and JavaScript are the two highest in demand IT-specific skills according to the data. But the saturation of jobs on the market isn’t as high as the demand for Java software engineers.</p>
									<p>Regarding to the generalised skills required in the IT industry according to the Burning Glass data, the role of a Penetration Tester required many of the top skills in demand. These skills include strong verbal and written communication skill, problem solving skills and teamwork capabilities. The large majority of these ‘soft skills’ are within the top 5 in demand skills.</p>

									<li><b>Jack</b></li><br>
									<p>Business Development Manager is not mentioned in the Burning Glass data. This position would generally be beneficial to a company with a large wages budget as this is not an essential position and will not guarantee revenue for the business. Although improving the efficiency of business processes could be profitable in the long run, it would not be a high priority for many companies running on tight budgets. It is likely that this title cannot be found on the Burning Glass Data as it is not IT-centric.</p>
									<p>The skills required for this position like organisation, leadership and communication are not specific IT skills, but they can be incorporated with IT. For example, communication between IT and business professionals requires a solid understanding of both fields in order to translate concepts.</p>

									<li><b>Akhil</b></li><br>
									<p>Akhil ranks fourth based on the Burning Glass data. This position requires both a combination of management and technical skills. A deep knowledge of IT technologies is required for this position. This includes knowledge of programming like Java, Python, SQL. It also requires understanding of cloud server solutions, virtual machines, networking. This position is not a direct path, but can only be achieved by gradual career growth.</p>
									<p>The general skills required for a Chief Technology Officer based on the data from Burning Glass includes communication skill, leadership quality, and keeping up to date on current and future technologies. </p>

										<p>In relation to the tables above outlining our collective skill set, the three highest ranking IT-specific skills that we don’t require are SAP, building relationships and business analysis and the three highest ranking general skills that are not in our required skill set are troubleshooting, planning and detail-oriented.</p>

										<p><b>Jake</b>’s opinion of his ideal job after reviewing all the industry data provided by Burning Glass has remained consistent. The world is already so interconnected, and we are moving at an exponential rate to further interconnectedness. With the world accelerating in this direction in the future there will always be a need for security and with the more things we connect to the internet the more targets arise for nefarious actors to attempt to infiltrate. As we learn to defend against these threats, they come back in different and more sophisticated ways. In IT the demand for cybersecurity experts will remain constant at the very least but more than likely increase with society increasing embracing the digital age every day. In summary, my opinion hasn’t change as there will always be a demand for cybersecurity in the decades to come and its only now that the world is waking up to its true importance in the wake of breaches like Saudi Aramco, talk-talk in the UK and WikiLeaks.</p>

										<p><b>Alan</b> originally thought software development would be his career goal. It wasn’t until Java and Object-Oriented design was offered as a unit through his IT degree that he quickly became immersed in Java. Using the Burning Glass data, it is easy to see that a career in Java development will be far more fruitful in the long run. Large corporations require a broader skillset in order to be considered, and this often alludes to longevity in the field. The past decade has seen Java become more integrated and streamlined with advances in mobile technology, as well as cloud technology. Big data has become the foundation of all industries and having this in a Java developers skillset makes a broader range of industries accessible. It is easy to see where Java development takes you compared to software development. In saying this, a lot more work is needed to build this career.</p>

										<p><b>Jack</b>’s opinion has not changed entirely. Becoming a business development manager would still be preferable. The idea of becoming a graphic designer is also very tempting as art/creativity-based activities are of interest to him. This could easily be integrated into a web design role as well. The job security and average salary of a Business Development Manager is also superior to that of a graphic designer. It then becomes a debate between pursuing a passion or money. Becoming a BDM contractor would be an alternative. Starting a business and creating a website/social media pages would allow me to incorporate some graphic design skills as well as maintaining the focus of being a Business Development Manager. Treating graphic design as a hobby rather than a career may be the best option.</p> 

										<p><b>Akhil</b>’s opinion still remained the same even after reviewing the data from Burning Glass. It is understood that this position is not a direct path, but can only be achieved by gradual career growth. The data helped to identify what all skills I lack and where to focus and what all I should acquire to get to my ideal job.</p>

										<p><b>Stephen</b>’s opinion on his ideal job has not changed after looking at the Burning Glass data.  The Burning Glass data reinforces his opinion on what his ideal job should be.  The role of a software developer is one of problem solving, creativity, and continuous learning. These skills lend themselves to a project based, collaborative, working environment which are essential skills for future proofing employment.  Nearly all sectors of industry require some sort of IT development through new software implementation, and as the majority of these programs are written in JavaScript or Java, the demand for such a position matches the Burning Glass highest ranked IT specific skills.  As many languages work together and not against each other, having knowledge these languages will be a strong base and allow for further exploration into fields such as Machine Learning. A software developer has the opportunity to learn about new technologies, different systems, and the business they are working in. Not being constrained to one specific skill makes software developing an exciting career path to choose.</p>
